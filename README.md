### Brief project description:
Property listing details and guest reviews can provide insights about how effective the platform's review system is in regulating the equilibrium of the home-sharing market. The team seeks to use the available data to determine the relationships between each review component and the hosts' listing prices. The relationships will be explored across groups of hosts based on segmentations such as geographical location, property type and amenities offered.
